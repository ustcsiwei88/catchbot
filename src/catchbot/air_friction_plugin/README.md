## A plugin for air friction simulation

Air_friction_plugin is a copy of gazebo_ros_force plugin.
We use a node to calculate the air friction based on the speed of ball and publish the force to this plugin, so that the force can be executed. 


This idea came from https://answers.ros.org/question/12554/simulating-air-friction-in-gazebo-for-flying-objects/
